        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Hi, I'm Kumba! Ever since I can remember, I've had a passion for
          creativity and problem-solving. That's what led me to the world of
          front-end web development. There's something magical about seeing an
          idea come to life in the browser whether it's a simple layout
          experiment or a complex interface for a bigger project.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          When I'm not coding, I love getting lost in a good book. My taste is
          pretty eclectic: I'll happily read everything from fantasy novels to
          biographies of tech pioneers. Reading helps me unwind and often sparks
          new ideas for my coding projects.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Another big passion of mine is the great outdoors. Hiking allows me to
          disconnect from the digital world and reconnect with nature. I love
          challenging hikes with rewarding views at the top. And if I'm not on
          the trails, you might catch me rock climbing the combination of mental
          focus and physical endurance is a perfect parallel to tackling tough
          coding challenges!
